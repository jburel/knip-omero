KNIME Image Proessing OMERO Integration
==========

OMERO is a client-server software for visualisation, management and analysis of biological microscope images (http://www.openmicroscopy.org/). OMERO handles all your images in a secure central repository. You can view, organise, analyse and share your data from anywhere you have internet access.

It is planed to tightly integrate with OMERO, i.e. allowing the the OMERO client INSIGHT to be started from within KNIME and to easily import the relevant images. Unfortunately this is still work in progress and only a highly experimental prototype node with limited functionality is available in the nightly build update site (working with an older OMERO version, see installation instructions). We are hopefully able to provide a first version of a more sophisticated OMERO node end of this year.
