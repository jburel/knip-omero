KNIME Image Processing - OMERO Integration
==========

[OMERO](http://www.openmicroscopy.org/) is a client-server software for visualisation, management and analysis of biological microscope images . OMERO handles all your images in a secure central repository. You can view, organise, analyse and share your data from anywhere you have internet access.

We plan a tight, bidirectional integration of OMERO and KNIME. Hence, the current OMERO Reader Node in KNIME allows you to start the [OMERO INSIGHT client](http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/omero4/users/client-tutorials/insight/getting-started.html) directly within KNIME to import images from an OMERO database.

Unfortunately writing images back to OMERO is not yet possible but we hope to further improve the integration of OMERO and provide bidirectional access to OMERO databases in the future.


Installation and Development
========

Please follow the installations instructions of the [KNIME Image Processing Extension](https://github.com/knime-ip/knip) and additionally add the KNIME Image Processing - OMERO Integration projects to your workspace.
