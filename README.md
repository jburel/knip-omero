KNIME Image Processing OMERO Integration
==========

OMERO is a client-server software for visualisation, management and analysis of biological microscope images (http://www.openmicroscopy.org/). OMERO handles all your images in a secure central repository. You can view, organise, analyse and share your data from anywhere you have internet access.

It is planed to tightly integrate with OMERO, i.e. allowing the the OMERO client INSIGHT to be started from within KNIME and to easily import the relevant images. This is still work in progress and only an experimental prototype node with limited functionality is available in the nightly build update site (working with an older OMERO version, see installation instructions on http://tech.knime.org/community/).
